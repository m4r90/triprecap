# MemoMap

## Project Overview
**MemoMap** - "Capture your travel memories, visualize them on the map."

MemoMap is an interactive platform that helps users organize and connect their travel memories—photos, notes, and experiences—to specific locations on a digital map. The goal is to make it easy to document, explore, and share travel experiences in an intuitive and visually appealing way.

## Features

### 1. Interactive Canvas Editor
- Add and modify text, images, and multimedia content
- Resize, rotate, and arrange elements freely
- Drag-and-drop functionality for intuitive organization

### 2. Geolocation Integration
- Associate journal pages with GPS coordinates
- View locations on an interactive map

### 3. Activity Tracking
- List recently modified journals and pages
- Version history and change logs
- Annotate and comment on travel memories

### 4. Security & Authentication
- Secure login with JWT authentication
- User management and access control
- Data protection and encrypted storage

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend: **React.js**
- Reusable component-based architecture
- Smooth navigation with React Router
